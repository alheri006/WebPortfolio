                    <h5> Graphic Designer</h5>
                    <p> Hi! I am Alheri Joseph Gandapa, a graphic designer based in  Lagos, Nigeria. My passion for graphic design has lasted over 12 years during which i have created designs for huge brands such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, Canva and a few others.
                        I'm a very disciplined person, open minded and I always aim for perfection. I dislike lack of communication and unproffessionalism. I have put together some of my best works for you. Feel free to explore!!</p>
